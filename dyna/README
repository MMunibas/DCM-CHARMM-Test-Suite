THIS FOLDER CONTAINS SAMPLE INPUTS FOR DYNAMICS RUNS WITH DIFFERENT DCM FEATURES.

PREP: THIS FOLDER IS FOR REFERENCE ONLY, TO SHOW HOW THE FILES FOR THE REMAINING TESTS WERE
OBTAINED AND TO ASSIST IN GENERATING FURTHER TESTS

NVE: TESTS PME FOR A TRIPEPTIDE WITH DCM CHARGES IN A TIP4P WATERBOX IN AN NVE ENSEMBLE. TOTAL
ENERGY SHOULD BE CONSERVED TO WITHIN A FEW TENTHS OF A KCAL/MOL. THIS CAN BE CHECKED VIA THE
FILE "ENER.DAT" PRODUCED AT THE END OF THE RUN

CPT: TESTS PME FOR A TRIPEPTIDE WITH DCM CHARGES IN A TIP4P WATERBOX IN AN NPT ENSEMBLE. TOTAL
PRESSURE SHOULD REMAIN STABLE, AS SHOULD TOTAL VOLUME OF THE WATERBOX. NOTE THAT THIS TERM IS
BASED ON THE VIRIAL AND VERY NOISY, THE MAIN THING TO CHECK FOR IS THAT THERE IS NO DRIFT, JUST
A VERY NOISY SERIES WITH A ROUGHLY FLAT RUNNING AVERAGE FOR THE VOLUME AND PRESSURES SAVED TO
THE .DAT FILES PRODUCED

NVE-POL AND CPT-POL: AS ABOVE BUT WITH SMOOTH CUT-OFFS IN PLACE OF PME AND WITH POLARIZABLE
SITES ADDED TO THE TRIPEPTIDE AND WATER MOLECULES. NOTE THAT THESE POLARIZABILITIES ARE MADE UP
VALUES AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR PRODUCTION RUNS
